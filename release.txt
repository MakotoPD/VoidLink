## Changes (v0.3.5)

### ✨ Features & Improvements
- **Enhanced Java Detection**: The `Auto-Detect` feature now intelligently scans the application's local data directory. Java versions downloaded via VoidLink are now automatically discovered and configured without manual path selection.
- **Better Installation Feedback**: Added clear visual feedback during Java installation, including exact download paths and success/failure system notifications (Toasts).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Linux/Tray Logic**: Fixed a race condition that prevented the application from closing correctly on Linux (and other platforms) when "Minimize to Tray" was disabled.

### 📦 Maintenance
- **Internal**: Updated Rust-side detection logic to support app-local Java paths.
