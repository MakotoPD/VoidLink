## ⚠️ Windows Security Warning (False Positive)

**Important Notice**: Due to unsigned binaries and the FRP sidecar, Windows Defender and other antivirus software may flag VoidLink as suspicious or potentially unwanted. **This is a false positive.**

### Why does this happen?
- The application includes FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) binary for tunneling functionality
- Unsigned applications trigger Windows SmartScreen warnings
- Network tunneling tools are often flagged by antivirus software

### How to safely install:

1. **Download from official sources only**: 
   - [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MakotoPD/VoidLink/releases)
   - Verify the SHA256 checksum provided in release notes

2. **Windows SmartScreen**:
   - Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"** when prompted

3. **Windows Defender** (if blocked):
   - Open **Windows Security** → **Virus & threat protection**
   - Click **Protection history**
   - Find VoidLink → **Actions** → **Allow**

4. **Optional**: Add an exception for VoidLink installation directory in your antivirus

We are working on code signing to eliminate these warnings in future releases.

## 🍎 macOS Troubleshooting (App is damaged)

If you see a message saying **"VoidLink is damaged and can't be opened"**, this is a normal security check for apps not signed with a paid Apple Developer certificate.

To fix this, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/VoidLink.app
```
(Make sure the app is in your Applications folder first).
